📂 telegram-uploader-frontend
telegram-uploader-frontend is a personal tool I developed to improve the efficiency of uploading files to a Telegram channel. It allows for the simultaneous upload of multiple documents, photos, and files without needing to manually open Telegram each time, which can be slow and cumbersome. This tool automates the process, making it faster and more streamlined for regular users of Telegram.

🔧 Features
Multiple file uploads: Upload documents, photos, or files to a Telegram channel simultaneously without having to open Telegram every time.
Speed improvement: Significantly reduces the time it takes to upload files by automating the process.
User-friendly interface: Easy to use with a simple, intuitive front end.
Telegram integration: Seamlessly connects to your Telegram channel, allowing quick and efficient uploads.
🚀 Why This Tool?
Telegram is widely used for its instant messaging and media-sharing capabilities, but it can be slow when it comes to uploading multiple files. Every time I needed to upload a document or image, I had to open Telegram and manually upload each file—an inefficient process that took too much time.

That's why I created telegram-uploader-frontend. This tool automates the upload process, allowing me to upload files to a Telegram channel simultaneously. Now, I don't have to wait for Telegram to load or upload files one at a time—everything is done much faster with minimal effort! 😌

📦 How It Works
Connect to Your Telegram Channel: First, configure the tool to connect to your specific Telegram channel.
Select Files: Choose the documents, images, or files you want to upload.
Upload Simultaneously: Click the upload button, and the tool will send all selected files to the channel in parallel, saving you time and hassle.
